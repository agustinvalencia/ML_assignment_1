# Assignment 1. Spam classification with nearest neighbors

1. Importing the data: 

```{r}
n = dim(data)[1]
set.seed(12345)
id = sample(1:n, floor(n*0.5))
train = data[id,]
test = data[-id,]
```

2. Use logistic regression to classify the training and test data by the classification principle
$\hat{Y} = 1$ if $p(Y=1 | X ) > 0.5 $, otherwise $\hat{Y} = 0$
